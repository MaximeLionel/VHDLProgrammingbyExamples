* VHDL has been at the heart of electronic design productivity since initial ratification by the IEEE in 1987.

# VHDL Terms
* Basic VHDL building blocks:
	* Entity - An entity is the most basic building block in a design.
	* Architecture:
		* The architecture describes the behavior of the entity.
		* A single entity can have multiple architectures.
		* One architecture might be behavioral while another might be a structural description of the design.
	* Configuration:
		* A configuration statement is used to bind a component instance to an entity-architecture pair.
